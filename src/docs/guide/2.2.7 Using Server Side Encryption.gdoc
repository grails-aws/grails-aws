AWS S3 files can be stored encrypted in S3, and AWS allows you to specify this as a request header.
To use this, simply set the useEncryption property to 'true' in the file upload closure. The plugin
will set the header for encryption and the file will be encrypted using AES-256 algorithm by AWS before storing in S3.

{code}
def uploadedFile = new File("/tmp/test.txt").s3upload {
    useEncryption true
}
{code}
