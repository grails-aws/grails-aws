You can delete files from Amazon S3 just knowing the bucket name and full path for it (just file name or path + file name)

It is damn simple, like the examples below

You'll first need to define the *aws* bean that is provided by the plugin:

{code}
class MyController { 

    def aws

    def myAction = {
        (...)
    }
}
{code} 

After that, you will use the *aws* bean and call the *s3()* method. This will return a helper for S3 Service. After that, you set the target bucket and then call the *delete* method.

h3. Deleting files stored on the root of some bucket (without path):

To delete the "photo.jpg" file stored under "my-app-bucket-photos" bucket (http://my-app-bucket-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/photo.jpg)

{code}
aws.s3().on("my-app-bucket-photos").delete("photo.jpg")
{code}

h3. Deleting one file stored in some path of one bucket:

To delete the "avatar.jpg" file stored under "my-app-bucket-avatars" bucket and path "/users/lucastex/" (http://my-app-bucket-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/users/lucastex/avatar.jpg)

{code}
aws.s3().on("my-app-bucket-avatars").delete("avatar.jpg", "/users/lucastex/")
{code}

h3. Deleting all files stored in some path of one bucket:

To delete all files stored under "my-app-bucket-avatars" bucket and path "/users/lucastex/" (http://my-app-bucket-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/users/lucastex/)

{code}
aws.s3().on("my-app-bucket-avatars").delete("/users/lucastex/")
{code}
